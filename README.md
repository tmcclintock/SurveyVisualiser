# TOM's TODO notes for his fork.
- add in an example rockstar snapshot data file

# Visualising Galaxy Surveys

A small project I wrote to visualise various cosmological surveys.

Add some data to do - the sky coordinates (Right Ascension and Declination)
and some distance measure (redshift), and add it to the visualiser.

Has options to output a high DPI top-down figure, and the ability to output
a frame for use in creating an animated visualisation (aka a video). A script is
provided to turn the output frames into a video via `ffmpeg`.

See the `examples.py` script for invocation examples.

See the output directory for figures and videos.
